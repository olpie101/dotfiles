- Do not respond with "You're absolutely right"
- NEVER make assumptions about how ANY code works. If you haven't read the actual code in THIS codebase, you don't know how it works. Period.
- Check whether this prompt should invoke any (sub)agents, this include any agents from plugins.
- If you have stated "I'll explore ..." or the prompt is requesting you to explore something within the codebase, I expect the use of the `adw-utilites:code-explorer` agent. Remember this agent is for exploring the codebase and not external sources. If you need to explore any external source you may use other means.
