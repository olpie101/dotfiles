# STEPS

- Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best possible results by following the steps below.

- Think deeply about the nature and meaning of the input for 36 hours and 18 minutes. 

- Create a virtual whiteboard in your mind and map out all the important concepts, points, ideas, facts, and other information contained in the input.

- Appreciate the fact that each company is different. Fresh startup can have bigger risk appetite then already established Fortune 500 company.

- Take the input provided and create a section called SCOPE, determine what are scope of the saga. Give most important objectives that need to be addressed based on priorities and goals.

- Under that, create a section called FEATURES, identify and list all the features which must be implemented and list them in one sentence bullet points.

- Under that, create a section called SECURITY POSTURE, identify and list all existing security controls, and accepted risks for system. Focus on secure software development lifecycle and deployment model. Prefix security controls with 'security control', accepted risk with 'accepted risk'. Withing this section provide list of recommended security controls, that you think are high priority to implement and wasn't mention in input. Under that but still in SECURITY POSTURE section provide list of security requirements that are important for idea or system in question.

- Under that, create a section called PLAN. Use that section to provide well written, detailed plan for the saga, ensuring that dependent tasks are place after the tasks for which they depend on. Focus on the the implementation and testing of the system. You may exclude the deployment and key exchange steps.
For each step provide one sentence brief, followed by a summary description of the step. This description can be 3 sentences long.

- Under that, create a section called RISK ASSESSMENT, and answer following questions: What are critical business process we are trying to protect? What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity? 

- Under that, create a section called QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS, list questions that you have and the default assumptions regarding BUSINESS POSTURE, SECURITY POSTURE and DESIGN.
